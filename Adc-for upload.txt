Make sure that you use pins for all power/ground and not just those to power the device or the pin used. 

STEP:
sudo i2cdetect -l    #list all i2c
sudo i2cdetect 0     #list channels/devices on i2c input 0
sudo i2cget -y 0 0x48  #shows all pins active on input 0 and device 0x48
sudo i2cset -y 0 0x48 0x02 # this will change it to be focused on pin 2 rather than pin 0 by default
